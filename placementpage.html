			<h1><b>PLACEMENT POLICY</b></h1>
			<p>Charotar University of Science and Technology (CHARUSAT) believes in producing 
			graduates with impactful employability skills. Towards this, a dedicated University 
			level Career Development and Placement Cell (CDPC) has been constituted for serving 
			students of all the programmes of Charusat. Out of several activities of CDPC, one 
			activity is to help and facilitate students to obtain job placements. This policy lays 
			down rules for this activity.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Eligibility For Campus Placement</h2>
			<p style="font-size:145%"><b>Following are the eligibility criteria for placement drives :</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>A Student must exhibit strong intentions for Placement. Any Student who wants 
					to go for Higher Studies or wants to become an entrepreneur shall not appear 
					for the Placements.</li><br>
				<li>Students with attendance record of minimum 80% and above will be eligible for 
					the campus placement assistance.</li><br>
				<li>Attendance for the Pre-Placement Talk is compulsory for the Placement aspiring students.</li>
			</ul><br>
			<h2>Preparation for Placement</h2>
			<p>CDPC conducts various activities to make student employable like Aptitude Preparation, 
			   Technical and soft skill expert sessions, domain knowledge sessions by industry experts 
			   and mock interviews. Placement desirous students must attended all the sessions organized 
			   by CDPC.</p><br>
			<h2>Placement Drive</h2>
			<p>CDPC approaches different organization for Campus Placement Drive for students. This 
			   can be On-campus at CHARUSAT campus or Off-campus (students need to visit company premises 
			   or other location for selection process). CDPC guarantees assistance to each eligible student 
			   at each stage of selection process to achieve their desirous job. However, placements are 
			   dependent on economic situation and student’s performance.<br><br>
			   Furthermore, the following need to be noted regarding On-campus and Off-campus processes :<br><br>
			   a) On-campus placement - companies visiting campus (in-person or virtually) - All drives will
				  be considered as on-campus wherever the data of students has been submitted via CDPC
				  team (centrally or at department/institute level) - Students may also appear directly (in-
                  person or virtually) as per the decisions made by companies in which case, they will be
				  considered in on-campus placement category. Any student who directly applies to the
                  companies visiting CHARUSAT by any means will be considered under on-campus
                  activities and will have to follow the placement policy. CDPC will help students at each
                  level up to the joining stage (in case of I+J) and also through the policy decisions required
                  to be taken at the companies in the future.<br><br>
				b) Off-campus - student(s) who are applying to the companies not associated with
				   CHARUSAT without any help from CHARUSAT, will be counted as off-campus applicants.
                   In this case, CDPC may only support the students for the interview preparations and will
                   not be responsible for the decisions made by the companies.
			</p><br>
			<h2>Selection Process</h2>
			<p style="font-size:145%"><b>The selection process may comprise of all or any of the combination of the following :</b></p>
            <p>
				1) Aptitude Test (written or online)<br>
				2) Technical Test (written or online)<br>
				3) Group Discussion<br>
				4) HR Round (Personal Interview)<br>
				5) Technical Round (Personal Interview)<br><br>
				A student is expected to perform excellently in each of the above stages to assure a placement.
				He/she should start his/her preparation from day one he/she takes admission.<br>
			</p><br>
			<h2>Post Placement</h2>
			<p>Every company visiting on/off campus declares their result on a same day after completion of
			   selection process. CDPC immediately declares the result to students once it is received from
               company. The University follows the policy of ‘one student one job’. Student will be considered
               as hired if his/her name appears in the list of selected candidates by any one company. No
               student will be allowed to appear for another job if placed in one company. In case a student gets
               selection from more than two companies on same day then the student can select any company
               based upon his/her preference.
